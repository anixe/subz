Alternatively you can clone this repository, rename it to `subz` and move it to your packages directory. Depending on your system it is:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3`
- OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`
- Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

# Setup

ARIZ file editting is definitely easier with following packages installed:

- [MarkdownTableFormatter](https://github.com/bitwiser73/MarkdownTableFormatter) for formatting sections
- [ANSIescape](https://github.com/aziz/SublimeANSI) for coloring tests output

In order to run aclr8-related commands, Sublime-Z must be able to find aclr8. Its path is stored in Sublime-Z settings in `aclr8_path` key.
You may provide there

- just the executable name if it is included in your `PATH` env variable
- absolute path to the executable (with or without `.exe` extension)
- absolute path to the root of aclr8 source

It may be good idea to first run `check aclr8 version` command and see if it works. If aclr8 is not found, Sublime-Z will ask you to enter the path. Check recipes for more details.

# Tips and tricks

- There are two versions of `[CONTRACT]` section. The `minimal` one inserts only minimum number of required properties while `full` inserts all possible properties.
- You don't have to type whole command. Typically, section name is enough to narrow down search results to single item.
- Output panel (at the bottom of the window) can be quickly closed by pressing `[Esc]`
- When some of the tests are failing, new tab will be opened. It ignores any changes and can be quickly closed by pressing `[ctrl] + w`
- You *don't* have to save the `.ion` file in order to run tests or query
- Use `Reformat ARIZ` command to add all sections headers and apply formatting

# Recipes:

## Check aclr8 version:

1. Run the command
  a. with mouse: choose `Tools -> Sublime-Z -> Aclr8 -> Check aclr8 version`
  b. with keyboard: press `[shift] + [ctrl] + p` to open command input and then type `Check aclr8 version`
2. If aclr8 is not found, you have to provide it in the input box that pops up at the bottom of the window and confirm with `[Enter]`
3. When everything is configured correctly, the command and aclr8 version should be shown in the output panel at the bottom of the window
